# First Django Project

## Installing packages
5. Type the following command in the terminal to install the Django Python package:

`pip3 install Django~=4.2.1`
Note: ~=4.2.1 installs any package version greater than or equal to 4.2.1 but less than 4.3

6. Once the package is installed, add it to the requirements.txt file with the following command:

`pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

7. It's good practice to check what packages have been installed. When you look in the requirements file, you can see that three packages were installed.

```python
asgiref==3.7.2
Django==4.2.7
sqlparse==0.4.4
```

## Creating a Django project 

8. Return to the terminal. In the terminal, create a Django project called my_project in the current directory.

---
**Important:**

Remember that the shortcut to refer to the current directory is a single dot . at the end of the command.

---
`django-admin startproject my_project .`

---
**Note:** 

Check in the explorer tab to see that the my_project project structure has been created.

---

9. Return to the terminal and start the Django server with the following command:

`python3 manage.py runserver`

10. Click on Open Browser.

11. This opens a scary-looking yellow error screen, don't worry! Your server is running properly. This error is telling you that, for security reasons, Django doesn't recognise the hostname - the server name your project is running on.


12. Select and copy the hostname after "Invalid HTTP_HOST header:". In this example, that is `'8000-niekados-firstdjangopro-wwpgflm5p0z.ws-eu114.gitpod.io'` - you can include the quotes.


13. In the `my_project/settings.py file`, paste the hostname between the square brackets of `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and save. For the above example, this would look like:

```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['8000-niekados-firstdjangopro-wwpgflm5p0z.ws-eu114.gitpod.io']
Add to ALLOWED_HOSTS
```

14. Now if you return to the browser tab and refresh you will see a bare-bones Django project.

---
**Note:** 

Return to the terminal and use ctrl-c to kill the server.

---

## Creating a Django app

15. Now we have a Django project created, we need to make an app. To do this, we use the manage.py file. In the terminal, type:

`python3 manage.py startapp hello_world`
---

**Note:**

Check the explorer panel to see the new hello_world app directory has been created.

---

##Â Creating Views

16. In hello_world/views.py, below from django.shortcuts import render, type:

`from django.http import HttpResponse`

17. Below the # Create your views here. comment, create the following Python function named index. Inside the function, we are returning a simple HTTP response.

18. Within parentheses after `HttpResponse` add the string `"Hello, world!"`

```python
# Create your views here.
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")
```

Creating our URLs
19. In my_project/urls.py, You'll see that this urls.py file already has some content in it. That's fine, we will need that in future. Let's include the view we just created.

20. Import the include function by appending it after a comma to the existing django.urls import.


21. Below that, import the views from the hello_world app.

from hello_world import views as index_views
Here we are giving the hello_world/views.py file an alias of index_views. In a one-app project, this would not be strictly necessary. However, in a multiple-app project using descriptive alias names makes your urls.py file much easier to read and maintain.
